## üìä EXIT STATISTICS (Across 12 Companies)

### Overall Exit Rate

- **Exited:** 1 company (8.3%)
- **Still Private:** 10 companies (83.3%)
- **Failed:** 1 company (8.3%) - Coros went out of business

### Why So Few Exits?

1. **Long Investment Horizons**: Investors waiting 10+ years for returns

3. **Valuation Gaps**: Private valuations may exceed public market willingness to pay
4. **Strategic Hold**: Companies and investors betting on larger future outcomes

## üîç COMPARISON: EXITED vs NON-EXITED COMPANIES

### Non-Exited Company Status

**10 of 11 remaining companies are generating revenue (90.9%)**

| Company | Years Active | Rounds | Latest Stage | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Ultrahuman** | 5.5 years | 6 rounds | 5th Round | Revenue |
| **Pulsetto** | 4.8 years | 6 rounds | 1st Round | Revenue |
| **Playmaker** | 4.8 years | 2 rounds | Early | Revenue |
| **ThingX** | 1.0 year | 1 round | 1st Round | Revenue |
| **Coros** | 4.4 years | 2 rounds | Failed | **Out of Business** |

**Note:** Several major companies (Oura, Whoop, Flow, GOQii, Empatica, Sensifai) have incomplete date data but are confirmed revenue-generating with 6-16 funding rounds each.

### The Coros Failure

- **Only failure** among 12 companies (8.3% failure rate)
- Received 2 funding rounds before shutting down
- Demonstrates that even in a hot sector, execution matters

---

## üìà EXIT TRENDS & PATTERNS

### 1. **MARKET LEADERS STAYING PRIVATE**

**Oura** and **Whoop** - the two most mature companies - remain private despite:
- 15-16 funding rounds each
- 10+ years of operation
- Strong market positions
- Generating significant revenue

**Why?** Likely reasons:
- High private market valuations (can raise without dilution of going public)
- Avoiding quarterly earnings pressure
- Maintaining strategic flexibility
- Waiting for more favorable IPO market conditions

### 2. **CHALLENGING PUBLIC MARKETS**

Catapult Sports' experience shows:
- Required **4 additional rounds** of capital after IPO
- Still **not profitable** after 10+ years public
- Demonstrates public market expectations vs. reality gap

This likely deters other companies from pursuing IPO route.

### 3. **ACQUISITION ACTIVITY: ZERO**

**No acquisitions** among these 12 companies suggests:
- Market is **pre-consolidation**
- No dominant acquirer has emerged (Apple/Google/Samsung haven't been aggressive)
- Companies prefer independence over being acquired
- Valuation expectations may be too high for strategic buyers

### 4. **LONG HOLDING PERIODS**

Average metrics for non-exited companies:
- **7.4 funding rounds** on average
- **Multiple years** between first funding and present
- Companies taking patient approach to building value

## üí° STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

   - Medical device companies may target health-focused wearables
   - But valuation gaps prevent deals currently

3. **Consolidation Coming**
   - 11 private companies competing in similar space
   - Market likely can't support all long-term

## üìå KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. ‚úÖ **Only Catapult Sports has exited (8.3%)** - via IPO in 2014 at $55M valuation

2. ‚è∞ **Extremely long holding periods** - Market leaders have been operating 10+ years without exit

3. üí™ **High survival rate** - 10/11 non-exited companies still generating revenue (90.9%)

4. üöÄ **Exit candidates emerging** - Oura and Whoop most likely to exit in next 2-3 years

5. üîÑ **Consolidation coming** - Market cannot support 11+ private companies long-term

6. üìâ **Public markets challenging** - Catapult still not profitable after 10+ years public

7. üéØ **Patient capital required** - Sector requires investors willing to wait 10-15 years for exits

8. üí∞ **No acquisition activity yet** - Zero M&A among these companies suggests pre-consolidation phase

---

## CONCLUSION

The wearable tech sector exhibits **extremely limited exit activity** with only 1 IPO in 14 years. This reflects a **pre-consolidation market** where investors are playing a long-term game, betting on substantial future outcomes from market leaders like Oura and Whoop.

The **Catapult Sports** example serves as both a success story (achieving liquidity) and a cautionary tale (struggling with profitability post-IPO). This dynamic likely influences other companies to delay exits until they can command premium valuations and demonstrate clearer paths to profitability.

**Expect accelerated exit activity in 2025-2027** as market leaders mature and the sector enters a consolidation phase, with 3-5 additional exits likely through a combination of IPOs and strategic acquisitions.
