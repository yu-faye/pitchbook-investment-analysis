**Why staying private?**
1. High private market valuations
2. Avoid quarterly earnings pressure

---

## CONCLUSION

The wearable tech sector has demonstrated **strong exit viability** with 4 IPO exits achieving valuations from $55M to $8.1B. The sector's **100% survival rate** for non-exited companies and multiple billion-dollar exits prove this is a viable investment category.

The **Fitbit** ($4.1B IPO ‚Üí $2.1B Google acquisition) and **Peloton** ($8.1B IPO) exits set benchmarks that likely influence current private leaders **Oura** and **Whoop** to stay private until they can achieve similar valuations.

The **2014-2019 exit window** was favorable, but the **5-year gap since 2019** reflects broader tech IPO market challenges, Peloton's post-IPO struggles, and rising profitability requirements.

**Expect renewed exit activity in 2025-2027** as IPO markets improve and market leaders (Oura, Whoop) reach optimal exit timing. The sector will likely undergo consolidation with 3-4 dominant players emerging and 60-70% achieving exits within 10 years.
