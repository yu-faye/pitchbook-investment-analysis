## üí° 7. KEY INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Future Entrants

1. **Entry Timing Matters Most**
   - Early movers (2011-2015) had highest success
   - Late entrants face saturated market
   - Need differentiation to succeed now

2. **Entry Mechanism Flexibility**
   - Multiple mechanisms work (seed, angel, accelerator)
   - Focus on fit, not specific mechanism
   - Accelerator backing effective for smaller rounds

3. **Capital Efficiency > Capital Size**
   - Oura and Whoop succeeded with modest initial rounds
   - Large rounds don't guarantee success (see Coros)
   - Focus on product-market fit first

4. **Market Waves Matter**
   - Each wave had distinct characteristics
   - COVID wave showed both opportunity and risk
   - Current entrants face toughest environment
   

### For Investors

1. **Early-Stage Seed Investments Worked Best**
   - Highest performing companies came from seed rounds
   - Average 11 rounds of follow-on funding
   - Look for 2013-2015 style opportunities in new sectors

2. **Accelerator-Backed Companies Underrated**
   - 100% success rate
   - 8.5 average rounds
   - Lower risk profile than direct VC

3. **Beware Large Early Rounds in Mature Markets**
   - Playmaker ($42M) and Coros ($6M) show mixed results
   - May indicate desperation or poor capital efficiency
   - Prefer lean, efficient builders
